C. Factors that Loan can be given on Condition of High Interest rate to mitigate any default risk leading to business loss:


1. NAME_HOUSING_TYPE: 
-Reason: High number of loan applications are from the category of people who live in Rented apartments 
         & living with parents and hence offering the loan would mitigate the loss if any of those default.
2. AMT_CREDIT: 
-Reason: People who get loan for 3-6 Lakhs tend to default more than others 
         and hence having higher interest specifically for this credit range would be ideal.
3. AMT_INCOME: 
-Reason: Since 90% of the applications have Income total less than 3Lakhs and 
            they have high probability of defaulting, they could be offered loan with higher interest compared 
            to other income category.
4. CNT_CHILDREN & CNT_FAM_MEMBERS: 
-Reason: Clients who have 4 to 8 children has a very high default rate and hence 
         higher interest should be imposed on their loans.**
5. NAME_CASH_LOAN_PURPOSE: 
-Reason: Loan taken for the purpose of Repairs seems to have highest default rate. 
         A very high number applications have been rejected by bank or refused by client in 
         previous applications as well which has purpose as repair or other. 
         This shows that purpose repair is taken as high risk by bank and either they are rejected, 
         or bank offers very high loan interest rate which is not feasible by the clients, 
         thus they refuse the loan. The same approach could be followed in future as well.

D. Suggestions: 
* 90% of the previously cancelled client have actually repayed the loan. 
Record the reason for cancellation which might help the bank to determine and negotiate terms with 
these repaying customers in future for increase business opportunity.

* 88% of the clients who were refused by bank for loan earlier have now turned into a repaying client. 
  Hence documenting the reason for rejection could mitigate the business loss and these clients could be 
  contacted for further loans.
